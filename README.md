### What I learned

In this project, as in the past, I struggled with making the web page responsive across different sizes.  I kept on fidgeting with various width percentages, min-widths, max-widths, etc. that eventually I chucked those out the window in favor of something simple that is adaptable on different devices (and without the use of media queries, too!).


### Continued development

On future projects, I will strive to follow the old adage "less is more" when it comes to responsive CSS design.
